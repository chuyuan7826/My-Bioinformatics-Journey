# Hi there 👋
Have you ever made up your mind to embark on practices in bioinformatics but didn't know where to start? I used to be like this as well, so I decided to record my learning path as a beginner in bioinformatics practice. I am still an undergraduate so I am learning new things at the same time. You can treat this repository as a guide, or a companion, or whatever you like. I will appreciate it if you find this repository helpful.

🍀 Now, you can go to the folders above 👆 to start with whatever you like!
